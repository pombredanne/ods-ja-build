\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface to the C++ Edition}

This book is intended to teach the design and analysis of basic data
structures and their implementation in an object-oriented language.
In this edition, the language happens to be C++.

This book is not intended to act as an introduction to the C++ programming
language.  Readers of this book need only be familiar with the basic
syntax of C++ and similar languages.  Those wishing to work with the
accompanying source code should have some experience programming in C++.

This book is also not intended as an introduction to the C++ Standard
Template Library or the generic programming paradigm that the STL
embodies.  This book describes implementations of several different data
structures, many of which are used in implementations of the STL. The
contents of this book may help an STL programmer understand how some of
the STL data structures are implemented and why these implementations
are efficient.
