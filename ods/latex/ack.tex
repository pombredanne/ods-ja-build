I am grateful to Nima~Hoda, who spent a summer tirelessly proofreading
many of the chapters in this book; to the students in the Fall 2011
offering of COMP2402/2002, who put up with the first draft of this book
and spotted many typographic, grammatical, and factual errors; and to
Morgan~Tunzelmann at Athabasca University Press, for patiently editing
several near-final drafts.
